# Quick Start Guide

Get the RB2B Lead Actionability System running in 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites Check

Before starting, ensure you have:

-   ‚úÖ **Node.js 18+** - Check with `node --version`
-   ‚úÖ **Ollama** - Download from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
-   ‚úÖ **Git** - For cloning the repository

## Installation

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd automate-rb2b

# Run the setup script
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

The setup script will:

-   Install all dependencies
-   Pull the llama3 model
-   Initialize the database
-   Seed demo data

### Option 2: Manual Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
cd backend && npm install && cd ..

ollama pull llama3.2:3b

# Seed demo data
npm run seed-demo
```

## Start the Application

### Step 1: Start Ollama

```bash
ollama serve
```

Keep this terminal open.

### Step 2: Start the Application

In a new terminal:

```bash
cd automate-rb2b
npm run dev
```

This starts:

-   Backend on `http://localhost:3001`
-   Frontend on `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 3: Open the App

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Ollama Not Connected

**Symptoms**: Yellow health check indicator, "Ollama not detected" message

**Solution**:

```bash
# Start Ollama
ollama serve

# Verify it's running
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

### Issue: llama3 Model Not Found

**Solution**:

```bash
ollama pull llama3
```

This downloads ~4GB and may take a few minutes.

### Issue: LinkedIn Login Required

**Symptoms**: LinkedIn scraping opens browser but shows login page

**Solution**:

1. Log into LinkedIn in the browser window
2. The session persists in `./backend/linkedin-session`
3. Future scrapes won't require login

### Issue: Port Already in Use

**Solution**:

```bash
# Find what's using port 3001 or 3000
lsof -i :3001
lsof -i :3000

# Kill the process or change port in:
# - backend/.env (PORT=3001)
# - frontend/vite.config.js (port: 3000)
```

### Issue: No Leads Showing

**Solutions**:

1. Click "Generate Demo Lead" button
2. Run `npm run seed-demo` to reset demo data
3. Check browser console for errors
